The `me` utility package is copied over from Pythonista, where it lives under
`site-packages` on-device for ease of importing. Elsewhere, you'll need to add
`/path/to/repo/2025` to `PYTHONPATH` to make these scripts work.

Run with `uv run --with aocd,parse run.py`. `AOC_SESSION` should be in your
environment.
