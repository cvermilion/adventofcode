# Advent of Code 2022

All of the solutions are written in Python3. The correct solution in each case
was computed in Pythonista on my phone, but in many cases I've made small
improvements later on my laptop.

Each can be run like:

    python3 run.py [--test]

The only external dependency is on the
[`parse`](https://pypi.org/project/parse/) library.

In a few cases the different parts are broken into separate files, or multiple
versions of the solution are present, in a way that should be reasonably
self-explanatory.

The input text files have an extension of `.py`; this is a quirk of Pythonista,
which insists on adding a `.py` extension to all files.
