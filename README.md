# Advent of Code 2017-2018

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles
for 2017 and 2018. Their current form is pretty messy; I may or may not clean
them up.

The entire initial code base was written on an iPhone in Pythonista, in Python 3
using almost no external dependencies. (For 2018 I did use the
[parse](https://pypi.org/project/parse/) package.)  Writing on an iPhone was
part interesting challenge, and partly so I could do the puzzles while holding a
newborn.

Many of the solutions were edited in place to produce the part 2 answer, so the
part 1 answer is no longer printed out.
