# Advent of Code 2017-2025

2024-2025: Continuing with Pythonista.

2023: Still on Pythonista. With some manual file copying into the on-phone
`site-packages`, I managed to get
[`aocd`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) working as a
dependency, which simplifies the data grabbing. To run these scripts with your
own data, just follow the README instructions there for putting `AOC_SESSION` in
your environment.

2020-2022: Reverted to Pythonista on my phone; spare time while I watch the kids
is the only time I have for this, so phone-coding works and it's a fun
constraint.

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles
for 2017-2019. 2017 and 2018 are a mess because I've imported them directly from
Pythonista on my phone; for 2019 I'm trying out Rust and they're cleaner.

For 2017 and 2018, the entire initial code base was written on an iPhone in
Pythonista, in Python 3 using almost no external dependencies. (For 2018 I did
use the [parse](https://pypi.org/project/parse/) package.)  Writing on an iPhone
was part interesting challenge, and partly so I could do the puzzles while
holding a newborn. Many of the solutions were edited in place to produce the part
2 answer, so the part 1 answer is no longer printed out.
