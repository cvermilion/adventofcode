# Advent of Code 2017

These are my solutions to the [2017 Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017)  puzzles. Their current form is pretty
messy; I may or may not clean them up.

The entire initial code base was written on an iPhone in Pythonista, in Python 3
using no external dependencies. Writing on an iPhone was part interesting
challenge, and partly so I could do the puzzles while holding a newborn.

Many of the solutions were edited in place to produce the part 2 answer, so the
part 1 answer is no longer printed out.
