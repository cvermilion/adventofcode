# square N has (2N-1)^2 at lower right corner
# biggest square of odd n smaller than 312051 is 557^2 = 310249, making 279 square rings
# right side, top and left add 558 each, gets to new lower left 311923
# input is 129 into bottom row, which is 559 across, so 280-129=151 from middle
# so distance is 151 + 279 = 430
